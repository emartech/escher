Implementations
===============

We are working hard on implementations. Please inform us if you would like to help us, and don't forget
to check out our :doc:`implementing` documentation for some instructions. All implementation should
use the language's package manager (if there's something like that) to install the library, and support
at least one common HTTP request representation for signing and authentication.
