"""
Watch a bunch of files and run a command if any changes are detected.

Usage
-----
::

    python watcher.py 'echo changes' one.py two.py

To automatically keep Sphinx docs up to date::

    python watcher.py 'make html' $(-regex '.*\.\(rst\|css\)')

Problems
--------

 * The file checking would be way more efficient using inotify or whatever the
   equivalent is on OS X.
 * It doesn't handle bad input or spaces in filenames.

But it works for me.
