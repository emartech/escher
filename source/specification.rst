Specification
=============

This document defines the Escher HTTP request signing framework.

Abstract
--------

The Escher HTTP request signing framework enables a third-party client
to securely access an HTTP service. It defines the creation of an
authorization header, and includes message integrity checking, and
can prevent replaying messages. Designed to be used with the HTTPS
protocol.

The framework is based on `Amazon's AWS4 authentication <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/RESTAuthentication.html>`_,
and compatible with Amazon services using their AWS4 protocol.

Status of This Memo
-------------------

This is a work in progress specification.

1. Introduction
---------------

The Escher HTTP request signing framework is intended to provide a
secure way for clients to sign HTTP requests, and servers to check
the integrity of these messages. The goal of the protocol is
to introduce an authentication solution for REST API services, that
is more secure than the currently available protocols.

`RFC 2617 (HTTP Authentication) <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617>`_
defines Basic and Digest Access Authentication. They're widely used,
but Basic Access Authentication doesn't encrypt the secret and doesn't
add integrity checks to the requests. Digest Access Authentication
sends the secret encrypted, but the algorithm with creating a checksum
with a nonce and using md5 should not considered highly secure these
days, and as with Basic Access Authentication, there's no way to check
the integrity of the message.

`RFC 6749 (OAuth 2.0 Authorization) <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749>`_
enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP
service, either on behalf of a resource owner by orchestrating an approval
interaction between the resource owner and the HTTP service, or by allowing
the third-party application to obtain access on its own behalf. This is
not helpful for a machine-to-machine communication situation, like a
REST API authentication, because typically there's no third-party user
involved. Additionally, after a token is obtained from the authorization
endpoint, it is used with no encryption, and doesn't provide integration
checking, or prevent repeating messages. OAuth 2.0 is a stateful
protocol which needs a database to store the tokens for client sessions.

Amazon and other service providers created protocols addressing these
issues, however there are no public standard with open source
implementations available from them. As Escher is based on a publicly
documented, widely, in-the-wild used protocol, the specification
does not include novelty techniques.

2. Signing an HTTP request
--------------------------

Escher defines a stateless signature generation mechanism. The signature
is calculated from the key parts of the HTTP request, a service identifier
string called **credential scope**, and a **client key** and **client secret**.

The signature generation steps are: canonicalizing the request, creating
a string to calculate the signature, and adding the signature to the
original request.

Escher supports two hash algorithms: `SHA256 and SHA512 <http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/documents/shs/sha256-384-512.pdf>`_
designed by the NSA (U.S. National Security Agency).

2.1. Canonicalizing the request
-------------------------------

In order to calculate a checksum from the key HTTP request parts, the
HTTP request method, the request URI, the query parts, the headers, and
the request body have to be canonicalized. The output of the
canonicalization step will be a string including the request parts
separated by ``LF`` (Line feed, "\n") characters.
The string will be used to calculate a checksum for the request.

2.1.1. The HTTP method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The HTTP method defined by `RFC2616 (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-5.1.1>`_
is case sensitive, and must be available in upper case, no transformation
has to be applied:

  ``POST``

2.1.2. The Path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The path is the absolute path of the URL. Starts with a slash (``/``)
character, and does not include the query part (and the question mark).

Escher follows the rules defined by `RFC3986 (Uniform Resource Identifier) <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`_
to normalize the path. Basically it means:

 * Convert relative paths to absolute, remove redundant path components
 * URI-encode each path components

   * the "reserved characters" defined by `RFC3986 (Uniform Resource Identifier) <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`_ have to be kept as they are (no encoding applied)
   * all other characters have to be percent encoded, including ``SPACE`` (to ``%20``, instead of ``+``)
   * non-ASCII, UTF-8 characters should be percent encoded to 2 or more pieces (``รก`` to ``%C3%A1``)
   * percent encoded hexadecimal numbers have to be upper cased (eg: ``a%c2%b1b`` to ``a%C2%B1b``)

 * Normalize empty paths to ``/``

For example:

  ``/path/resource/``

2.1.3. The Query String
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`RFC3986 (Uniform Resource Identifier) <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`_ should provide guidance for
canonicalization of the query string, but here's the complete list of the rules to be applied:

 * URI-encode each query parameter names and values

   * the "reserved characters" defined by `RFC3986 (Uniform Resource Identifier) <http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>`_ have to be kept as they are (no encoding applied)
   * all other characters have to be percent encoded, including ``SPACE`` (to ``%20``, instead of ``+``)
   * non-ASCII, UTF-8 characters should be percent encoded to 2 or more pieces (``รก`` to ``%C3%A1``)
   * percent encoded hexadecimal numbers have to be upper cased (eg: ``a%c2%b1b`` to ``a%C2%B1b``)

 * Normalize empty query strings to empty string
 * Sort query parameters by the encoded parameter names (ASCII order)
 * Do not shorten parameter values if their parameter name is the same (``key=B&key=A`` is a valid output),
   the order of parameters in a URL may be significant (this is not defined by the HTTP standard)
 * Separate parameter names and values by ``=`` signs, include ``=`` for empty values, too
 * Separate parameters by ``&``

For example:

  ``foo=bar&abc=efg``

2.1.4. The Headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To canonicalize the headers, the following rules have to be followed:

 * Lower case the header names
 * Separate header names and values by a ``:``, with no spaces
 * Sort header names to alphabetical order (ASCII)
 * Group headers with the same names into one header, and separate their values by commas, without sorting
 * Trim header values, keep all the spaces between quote characters (``"``)

For example:

.. code-block:: http

   accept:*/*
   user-agent:example-client
   connection:close
   content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   content-length:21
   host:example.com

2.1.5. Signed Headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The list of headers to include when calculating the signature. Lower cased value of header names,
separated by ``;``, like this:

  ``date;host``

2.1.6. Body Checksum
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A checksum for the request body, aka the payload has to be calculated. Escher supports SHA-256 and SHA-512
algorithms for checksum calculation. If the request contains no body, an empty string has to be used as
the input for the hash algorithm.

The selected algorithm will be added later to the authorization header, so the server will be able to use
the same algorithm for validation.

The checksum of the body has to be presented as a lower cased hexadecimal string, for example:

  ``fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210``

.. _canonicalized_request_example:

2.1.7. Concatenating the canonicalized parts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All the steps above produce a row of data, except the headers canonicalization, as it creates one row per headers.
These have to be concatenated with ``LF`` (Line feed, "\n") characters into a string. An example:

.. code-block:: string

   POST
   /path/resource/
   foo=bar&abc=efg
   accept:*/*
   user-agent:example-client
   connection:close
   content-type:application/x-www-form-urlencoded
   content-length:21
   host:example.com
   date;host
   fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210fedcba9876543210

2.2. Creating the signature
---------------------------

The next step is creating another string which will be directly used to calculate the signature.

2.2.1. Algorithm ID
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **algorithm ID** is an identifier coming from the **algo_prefix** (default value is ``ESR``) and the algorithm
used to calculate checksums during the signing process. The strings **algo_prefix**, "HMAC", and the algorithm
name should be concatenated with dashes, like this:

  ``ESR-HMAC-SHA256``

2.2.2. Long Date
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The long date is the request date in the `ISO 8601 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_ *basic* format,
like ``YYYYMMDD + T + HHMMSS + Z``. Note that the basic format uses no punctuation. Example is:

  ``20141022T120000Z``

This date has to be added later, too, as a date header (default header name is ``X-Escher-Date``).

2.2.3. Date and Credential Scope
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Next information is the **short date**, and the **credential scope** concatenated with a ``/`` character.
The **short date** is the request date's date part ISO 8601 basic formatted representation, the
**credential scope** is defined by the service. Example:

  ``20141022/eu-vienna/yourproductname/escher_request``

This will be added later, too, as part of the authorization header (default header name is ``X-Escher-Auth``).

2.2.4. Checksum of the Canonicalized Request
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Take the output of step *2.1.7.*, and create a checksum from the canonicalized checksum string.
This checksum has to be presented as a lower cased hexadecimal string, too. Something like this
will be an output:

  ``0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef``

.. _signing_string_example:

2.2.5. Concatenating the Signing String
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Concatenate the outputs of steps 2.2. with ``LF`` characters. Example output:

.. code-block:: string

   ESR-HMAC-SHA256
   20141022T120000Z
   20141022/eu-vienna/yourproductname/escher_request
   0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef

.. _signing_key_algorithm:

2.2.6. The Signing Key
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The signing key is based on the **algo_prefix**, the **client secret**, the parts of the **credential scope**,
and the request date.

Take the **algo_prefix**, concatenate the **client secret** to it. First apply the HMAC algorithm to
the **request date**, then apply the actual value on each of the **credential scope** parts
(splitted at ``/``). The end result is a binary signing key.

Pseudo code:

.. code-block:: ruby

   signing_key = algo_prefix + client_secret
   signing_key = HMAC.Digest(short_request_date, signing_key)
   foreach credential_scope.split('/') as scope_part
     signing_key = HMAC.Digest(scope_part, signing_key)
   end_foreach
   return signing_key

2.2.7. Create the Signature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The signature is created from the output of steps *2.2.5.* (Signing String) and *2.2.6.* (Signing Key). With
the selected algorithm, create a checksum. It has to be presented as a lower cased hexadecimal string.
Something like this will be an output:

  ``abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcd``

.. _add the signature:

2.3. Adding the Signature to the Request
----------------------------------------

The final step of the Escher signing process is adding the Signature to the request. Escher adds a new header
to the request, by default the header name is ``X-Escher-Auth``. The header value will include the Algorithm ID
(see *2.2.1.*), the *client key*, the **short date** and the **credential scope** (see *2.2.3.*), the
**signed headers** string (see *2.1.5.*) and finally the signature (see *2.2.7.*).

The values of this inputs have to be concatenated like this:

.. code-block:: string

  ESR-HMAC-SHA256 Credential=CLIENT_KEY/20141022/eu-vienna/yourproductname/escher_request,
  SignedHeaders=date;host, Signature=abcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcdabcd

3. Presigning an URL
--------------------

The URL presigning process is very similar to the request signing procedure. But for an URL, there are
no headers, no request body, so the calculation of the Signature is different. Also, the Signature cannot
be added to the headers, but included as query parameters.

A significant difference is that the presigning allows defining an expiration time. By default, it is
86400 secs, 24 hours. The current time and the expiration time will be included in the URL, and the
server have to check if the URL is expired.

3.1. Canonicalizing the URL to presign
--------------------------------------

The canonicalization for URL presigning is the same process as for HTTP requests,
in this section we will cover the differences only.

3.1.1. The HTTP method
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The HTTP method for presigned URLs is fixed to:

  ``GET``

2.1.2. The Path
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The path is coming from the URL, and the same canonicalization process have to be
applied to them, as for HTTP requests.

For example:

  ``/path/resource/``

2.1.3. The Query String
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The query is coming from the URL, but the algorithm, credentials, date, expiration time,
and signed headers have to be added to the query parts.

  ``foo=bar&abc=efg``

2.1.4. The Headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An URL has no headers, Escher creates the Host header based on the URL's domain information, and
maintains adds it to the canonicalized request.

For example:

.. code-block:: http

   host:example.com

2.1.5. Signed Headers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It will be `host`, as that's the only header included. Example:

  ``host``

4. Validating requests
----------------------
