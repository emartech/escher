Publish Your Library
====================

If you have an implementation, even if it's a work in progress, please share
the news with us. It would be great if you can also open source your project,
and we can start using it together, as we are doing with other implementations.

If you agree to include your library on the site, we are going to check your
source code, and do a basic audit and give some feedback. If everything going
fine, it will be promoted on this site.
