Escher is a **stateless HTTP request signing library** to allow secure authorization and request validation. It is a generalized version of Amazon's AWS Signature Version algorithm. The goal was implementing a protocol where every request is validated, and impossible to modify without knowing the secret.

Escher is great for creating secure REST API servers, both the **request signing**, and **validation** are implemented. The protocol also provides a solution for **presigning URLs** with expiration.

The status is **work in progress**.

Your help will be *much welcomed*, we are especially interested in **code reviews**, **library implementations in different languages**, **writing the documentation** and **promotion**.
